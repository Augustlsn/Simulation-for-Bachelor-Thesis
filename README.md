# Simulation for Bachelor Thesis
This repository contains the simulation code for my Bacheelor Thesis.

1. Asymptotic-Variance_Simulation: code to calculate the asymptotic covariance matrix for the plug-in estimator of the 2-path / 3-Path

2. Bayesian_Sampling_for_Posterior: code to sample from the posterior distribution for the stated prior and also calculate the sample covariance of the posterior mean.
